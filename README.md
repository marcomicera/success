> When competition is fierce, being talented and hard-working is important, but it's not enough to guarantee success.
>
> You also need to catch a break.
>
> Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck because, by definition, it's not something we did.\
> Like the housework done by your significant other, it goes unappreciated.
>
> And here's the crazy thing:
> downplaying the importance of chance events may actually improve your probability of success because
> if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain, you're less likely to invest effort in it,
> which further decreases your chances of success.
>
> So, it's a useful delusion to believe you are in full control of your destiny.

## Simulation description

> The importance of luck increases the greater the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces.
>
> Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts.\
> From over 18,300 applicants in 2017,
> only 11 were selected and went on to graduate from the astronaut training program.
>
> Now we can make a toy model of the selection process:
> let's assume that astronauts are selected mostly based on skill,
> experience, and hard work, but also say five percent as a result of luck â€” fortunate circumstances.
> 
> For each applicant, I randomly generated a skill score out of a hundred,
> and I also randomly generated a luck score out of a hundred.\
> Then I added those numbers together, weighted in the 95-to-5 ratio to get an overall score.\
> This score represents the selector's judgments, meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts.
>
> And I repeated this simulation a thousand times representing a thousand different astronaut selections.\
> And what I found was the astronauts who were picked were very lucky; they had an average luck score of 94.7.
>
> So how many of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone?\
> The answer was, on average, only 1.6.\
> That means, even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected
> would have been different if luck played no role at all.
